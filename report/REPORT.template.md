## Introduction

The number of new drugs approved per billion dollars of inflation-adjusted R&D spending halved roughly every nine years from 1950 to 2010, an ~80-fold fall ([Scannell et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd3681)); the decline has flattened since about 2010 ([Ringel et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41573-020-00059-3)). Only 7.9% of drug development programs (drug–indication pairs) that enter Phase 1 reach FDA approval, and 6.8% for novel drugs ([Thomas et al. 2021, BIO](https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf)). More than nine in ten programs that enter the clinic never reach approval, and we can see little of why.

Existing analyses offer a few data points:

* Nelson et al. (2015) estimated that human genetic support could roughly double the chance of success in clinical development ([Nelson et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3314)). With a decade more genetic data, target–indication pairs with genetic support were 2.6 times as likely to progress from Phase 1 to launch ([Minikel et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07316-0)).
* Of 174 Phase 2 and Phase 3 failures in 2013–2015 whose sponsors gave a reason, 52% were for efficacy and 24% for safety ([Harrison 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd.2016.184)).
* A review of AstraZeneca's 2005–2010 pipeline distilled five technical determinants of success, the "5Rs": right target, tissue, safety, patient and commercial potential ([Cook et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd4309)). After the company adopted the framework, its success rate from candidate nomination to Phase 3 completion rose from 4% to 19% ([Morgan et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd.2017.244)).

Scannell and colleagues called the decline Eroom's Law (Moore's Law backwards) and attributed it to four causes ([Scannell et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd3681)):

1. **"Better than the Beatles":** each new drug must beat a growing catalogue of cheap, effective generics.
2. **The cautious regulator:** the bar for safety and evidence keeps rising.
3. **"Throw money at it":** the tendency to add people and money to R&D.
4. **The "basic research–brute force" bias:** overestimating how much molecular biology and high-throughput screening raise the chance that a molecule works in the clinic.

[Scannell and Bosley (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147215) later used decision theory to show that a model's *predictive validity*, meaning how well its output tracks the clinical outcome, matters far more than its throughput, and proposed that a fall in the predictive validity of the industry's screening and disease models explains much of the decline.

## A history of drug development

Over the past century, drug development moved from natural observation and phenotypic screening to target-based and genetically grounded hypotheses. Each era narrowed the unit of the biological hypothesis, from a whole-organism effect to a target in a specific patient context.

| Period | Technological developments | Biological hypothesis | Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Pre-1900 to 1930s | Observation, natural products, physiology | Therapeutic effect or organismal phenotype | Morphine, quinine, digitalis, aspirin |
| 1900s–1960s | Quantitative pharmacology and biochemistry | Receptor activity, enzyme, metabolic pathway | Sulfonamides, receptor theory, enzyme inhibitors |
| 1950s–1980s | Systematic medicinal chemistry | Desired pharmacological mechanism | β-blockers, H2 antagonists, antimetabolites |
| 1970s–1990s | Recombinant DNA and molecular cloning | Named gene and protein | Recombinant insulin, cloned GPCRs, channels, kinases |
| 1990s–2000s | Genomics, HTS, automation | Target plus compound library | Imatinib and kinase programs, genomic target portfolios |
| 2000s–2010s | Human genetics and functional genomics | Target–disease association | GWAS, RNAi, CRISPR, dependency maps |
| 2010s–present | Multimodal evidence integration and predictive modeling | Target–indication–mechanism–patient context | Open Targets, gnomAD, single-cell perturbation, AlphaFold |

## Historical case studies

The cases below each looked strong on mechanism, cell and animal evidence, and failed in humans.

| Drug (indication) | Evidence that looked strong | Why it failed |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| BACE1 inhibitors: verubecestat, lanabecestat, atabecestat (Alzheimer's disease) | Crystal structures; Aβ lowering in cells and animals; a protective human *APP* variant (A673T) that reduces BACE1 cleavage; CSF Aβ down 50–90% in Phase 1 | No slowing of decline. In the verubecestat (prodromal) and atabecestat (preclinical) trials cognition worsened early, with a dose-related effect that reversed after stopping, consistent with BACE1's other neuronal substrates. Reducing Aβ production did not help people who already had plaques; antibodies that clear plaque (lecanemab, donanemab) later slowed decline modestly. ([Egan 2018](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1706441); [Egan 2019](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1812840); [Sperling 2021](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.4857)) |
| Torcetrapib and later CETP inhibitors (cardiovascular disease) | Raised HDL in people with CETP deficiency; HDL up 60–70% as predicted; less atherosclerosis in rabbits | Torcetrapib increased deaths by 58% (93 vs 59) and major cardiovascular events by 25%, probably through an off-target rise in aldosterone and blood pressure. Dalcetrapib and evacetrapib raised HDL without cutting events. Anacetrapib cut major coronary events by 9%, in line with its modest non-HDL-cholesterol lowering, and was not filed. ([Barter 2007](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa0706628); [Schwartz 2012](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1206797); [Lincoff 2017](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1609581); [HPS3/TIMI55–REVEAL 2017](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1706444)) |
| Semagacestat (Alzheimer's disease) | Aβ lowering in cells and mice; dose-dependent 47–84% cut in CNS Aβ production in a small human kinetic study | Did not slow decline. At the higher dose, daily function worsened significantly faster than on placebo and cognition trended worse. Patients had more skin cancers, infections and weight loss, consistent with blocking γ-secretase substrates such as Notch. ([Doody 2013](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1210951)) |
| Solanezumab, bapineuzumab (Alzheimer's disease) | Aβ binding; plaque prevention in transgenic mice; peripheral Aβ engagement (solanezumab) and partial plaque lowering on PET in APOE4 carriers (bapineuzumab) | No cognitive benefit across several Phase 3 trials. Solanezumab binds soluble Aβ and did not remove plaque; bapineuzumab's dose was capped by brain swelling (ARIA). Antibodies that cleared plaque more deeply later slowed decline modestly, so these failures look more like insufficient target engagement than a misleading mouse model. ([Doody 2014](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1312889); [Salloway 2014](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1304839)) |
| TGN1412 (B-cell leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis) | Cynomolgus monkeys tolerated 500 times the human starting dose | All six volunteers who received the drug developed a cytokine storm within 90 minutes. Unlike in the monkeys used for toxicology, human CD4+ effector memory T cells carry CD28. The starting dose already occupied most CD28 receptors; human-cell assays and dosing from the minimal anticipated biological effect level would have flagged the risk. ([Suntharalingam 2006](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa063842); [Eastwood 2010](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.00922.x); [Stebbings 2007](https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.179.5.3325)) |
| Fialuridine (hepatitis B) | Clean toxicology in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys | Seven of 15 patients developed liver failure with lactic acidosis: five died and two needed transplants. Human ENT1, unlike the rodent transporter, is targeted to mitochondria and carries the drug into them. ([McKenzie 1995](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199510263331702); [Lee 2006](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M513825200)) |
