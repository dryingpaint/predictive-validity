# Benchmark framework

Evaluates any target-scoring model against historical `(target × indication)` FDA approval outcomes.

## Task definition

**Given:** a (target × indication) pair and 40+ dimensions of preclinical evidence.
**Predict:** P(any drug on this T-I gets FDA-approved for THIS indication) — strict per-indication outcome.
**Ground truth:** `preclin.v_target_indication_strict_outcome.strict_approved_this_ti`.
**Headline cohort:** T-I pairs where ≥1 non-placebo program reached Phase 1+
and approval-independent source priority, confidence, and independent-source
corroboration identify one unique primary target (n=10,685; 336 approved; 792
targets). Exact strongest ties remain unresolved.

`nelson_tier` is temporarily excluded from canonical predictive scorers because its current-day evidence can postdate clinical outcomes. The corrected headline cohort has complete Nelson coverage; stored tiers remain available for audit and sensitivity analysis.

`analyses/nelson_inclusive_benchmark.py` is the explicit sensitivity path. It
keeps the canonical feature list unchanged, uses the same Phase 1+ strict
cohort and held-out-target folds, encodes T0-T3 as one ordered feature, and
rejects any missing tier rather than treating absent adjudication as T0.

## Scorer registry

Everything in `benchmark/scorers_*.py` implements the same interface:

```python
def scorer(evidence: dict, context: dict) -> dict:
    return {
        'predicted_p_approval': float in [0, 1],
        'predicted_tier': 'low' | 'medium' | 'high',
        'top_supporting_dims': [str],
        'top_concerning_dims': [str],
        'score_confidence': 'low' | 'medium' | 'high',
        'n_features_used': int,
    }
```

Registered scorers:

| File | Scorer names | Method |
|---|---|---|
| `scorers_rule_based.py` | random_v1, family_precedent_v1, genetic_only_v1, rs_composite_v1 | Hand-weighted rule-based |
| `scorers_ml.py` | logreg_strict_v1, lightgbm_robust_strict_v1, randomforest_strict_v1 | Trained ML, 5-fold CV |
| `scorers_ensemble.py` | stacked_v1 | LogReg meta-learner over base models |
| `scorers_pheiron.py` | pheiron_rs_composite_v1 | Untrained published Pheiron RS |
| `scorers_llm_agent.py` | sonnet_agent_sdk_v1 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 reads evidence, predicts |

## Metrics

Every benchmark run stores:

- **AUC-ROC** — overall discrimination; current v5 headline runs use a
  1,000-draw target-cluster bootstrap (seed 42), while historical runs used a
  200-draw row bootstrap
- **Brier score** — calibration + refinement combined
- **Recall @ top-k%** — of top-k% scored T-Is, fraction of positives captured
- **Precision @ top-k%** — of top-k% scored T-Is, fraction that were positive
- **RS (top decile)** — P(approved | top 10%) / P(approved | rest). Direct Pheiron-comparable.
- **ECE (Expected Calibration Error)** — mean absolute gap between predicted probability and observed rate

## Run all baselines

```bash
export DATABASE_URL='...'
python3 runner.py                   # runs all registered rule-based scorers
python3 scorers_ml.py               # LogReg, LGB robust, RF on strict outcome
python3 scorers_ensemble.py         # stacked
python3 scorers_pheiron.py          # untrained Pheiron RS composite
python3 scorers_llm_agent.py 200    # Sonnet agent on 200 T-Is
```

## Plug in your own model

**Path 1** (Python callable): implement the scorer interface, `register_scorer(name, fn)`, run `runner.py <name>`.

**Path 2** (external CSV): produce `(target_id, indication_id, predicted_p_approval)` rows, wire in via `wire_external_scores()` in `external_template.py`.

## Score a novel (not-yet-clinical) target × indication hypothesis

Everything above scores T-I pairs already in the cohort (≥1 Phase 1+ program). For scoping a brand-new
target before any clinical program exists — e.g. an internal discovery program — use
`score_novel_target.py`:

```bash
python3 benchmark/score_novel_target.py --csv examples/capable_targets.csv --out results.json
# or single-pair:
python3 benchmark/score_novel_target.py --gene SIK3 --indication "Idiopathic Hypersomnia" --area other
```

This is genuine out-of-cohort extrapolation, not a lookup, and it differs from naively reusing
`v_target_evidence_wide` in two ways that matter — both documented at length in the module docstring:

1. **Category A/D evidence is re-scoped to the specific indication**, not borrowed from the target's
   best-evidenced disease overall (which is a real, easy-to-make mistake — see the module docstring for
   a case where two targets had strong genetic evidence for Epilepsy that had nothing to do with the
   indication actually being scored).
2. **`nelson_tier` must be left unset for uncurated targets.** Setting it — even to `T0`, meant to look
   conservative — triggers a leakage artifact (documented with the exact cohort statistics in the module
   docstring) that pushes every score to ~0.99. The tool refuses to set it without an explicit
   acknowledgment flag.

See `examples/capable_targets.csv` for a worked example (7 preclinical GPCR/kinase programs, including
cases with zero disease-specific evidence and one indication with no Open Targets entry at all).

## Query the leaderboard

```sql
SELECT * FROM preclin.v_benchmark_leaderboard;
```

The CSV snapshot at `../data/leaderboard.csv` mirrors this at commit time.

## Best scorer

For predicting FDA approval on strict per-indication outcome, **held-out target
5-fold CV, approval-independent consensus-target Phase 1+ cohort n=10,685**:

1. `logreg_final_no_nelson_target_bootstrap_v5` — AUC 0.571 [0.520, 0.616] (poorly calibrated)
2. `stacked_final_no_nelson_target_bootstrap_v5` — AUC 0.570 [0.515, 0.620] (canonical calibrated model)
3. `stacked_final_with_nelson_target_bootstrap_v5` — AUC 0.602 [0.555, 0.645] (current-day evidence sensitivity only)
4. `logreg_final_with_nelson_target_bootstrap_v5` — AUC 0.612 [0.565, 0.654] (current-day evidence sensitivity only)

Matched controls are generated by `analyses/random_control_benchmark.py`:
`random_target_rank_control_v5` has median AUC 0.501 with a 95% null range of
0.459–0.545, and `prevalence_only_control_v5` has AUC 0.500.

Historical rule-based and LLM results were not regenerated after the exclusion and are not presented as current comparisons.
